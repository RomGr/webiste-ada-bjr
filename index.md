# Introduction

How useful First, we are using tools from graph theory to further investigate and compare networks from the original paper and a similar one from the social media Reddit. We are looking into graph-efficiency and small-world metrics. We are then trying to corroborate the hypothesis that the graph consists mainly of positive clusters and negative bridges between them by checking if the sparsest cut does disproportionally affect negative edges. Second, we wish to come up with models that predict edge signs to better understand the psychology of signed interactions on social media. We are using matrix factorization and logistic regression. The former is handily interpretable; latent variables can be seen as modeling the factors that contribute to the esteem for and from other types of users. Matrix factorization thus implicitly generates individual preference profiles for each user. The latter is applied to disentangle the magnitude of effects suggested by theories on status, balance, and embeddedness.

Research Questions

Are signed networks from different social media platforms alike in terms of additional graph-theoretical properties?
Are these networks efficient and do they have small-world properties?
Can we validate the claim made by Leskovec et al. that negative edges tend to connect dense positive clusters?
Is it possible to predict the sign of an edge accurately? What can such a models reveal about the psychology of signed interactions on social media?

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
