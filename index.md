# Introduction
Would it be possible to predict the kind of interaction (i.e. positive or negative) that one would have with another, based on his previous interactions? With the use of signed social network data, we thought that this challenge can be met. If this appears to be true, models predicting edge signs might help to better understand the psychology of signed interactions on social media. Matrix factorization could generates individual preference profiles for each user. These profile could be applied in further studies to disentangle the magnitude of effects suggested by theories on status, balance, and embeddedness.

# Research Questions
1. Are signed networks from different social media platforms alike in terms of additional graph-theoretical properties?
2. Are these networks efficient and do they have small-world properties?
3. Can we validate the claim made by Leskovec et al. that negative edges tend to connect dense positive clusters?
4. Is it possible to predict the sign of an edge accurately? What can such a models reveal about the psychology of signed interactions on social media?

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>

<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
